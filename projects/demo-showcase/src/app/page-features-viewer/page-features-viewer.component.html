    <p>
        Features viewer allows to represents features on a protein sequence. It takes as input the target `Sequence` and
        a list of `Feature` objects. The `Sequence` represents an amino-acid sequence, hence it must be a list of valid
        amino-acid one-letter codes.
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>
        Each `Feature` object characterizes either a single or a range of amino-acids.
    </p>
    <!-- Sub-section: positional -->
    <div>
        <h3>Positional features</h3>
        <p>
            A `Feature` characterizing single amino-acids must contain an array of values which length is the same as
            the length of the input sequence. Each value is associated to the input sequence by means of its index.
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Sub-section: range -->
    <div>
        <h3>Range features</h3>
        <p>
            A feature characterizing a range of amino-acid is defined hereby as a `Loci`. A `Loci` is an object which
            contains the `start` and `end` properties, indexing two valid positions in the sequence. A position is
            considered to be valid if it is a valid index over the input sequence. Moreover, the `start` and `end`
            properties are considered to be valid only if the former has not a bigger value than the latter. `start`,
            `end` positions used in `Loci` features are inclusive, hence amino-acids indexed by those preoperties are
            included in the range, as well as those comprised between them.
